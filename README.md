# Code
Various code that I develop. Publishing here for recruiters to see :P and also as a backup !

VCDWriter - A C++ class that can help to write or generate a VCD Dump file. 

CodingSites - Contains solutions to problems from coding sites like TopCoder/CodeChef etc. 
The File name will be the problem identifier used in these sites. 
Hence you can find the problem details in these sites and match the solution with that.

I use Visual code or Visual studio alternatively, hence you will see those project files as well.
oflate am using only VIsual studio and C++.
Open the Visual studio project and add the C++ file you want to compile and run to the project. Build and run and provide command line inputs etc.
